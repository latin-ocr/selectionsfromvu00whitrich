INTRODUGTION

ΤΗΕ VULGATE (Editio Uulqata ,· uuzqata=“ popular '’) is the
Latin translation 01 13116 Β11)16, from the Hebrew 01 15116 Old·
Testament, and the Greek 01 13116 New‚ made by St. J erome
¹ during the years A.D. 383-405. For over a thousand years
it was the sole form in which the Bible was known to Western
Europe, and it remains to this day the Authorized Version
01 the Roman Ohurch.

It was 11015, however, the first Latin version. Very early
in 15116 history 01 13116 Ohurch certain books 01 15116 Bibla—
especially the Gospels and the Book 01 Psalms—had been
translated by unknown 801101618. Their work had been
done quite simply, and with no attempt at literary elegance.
Just as the New Testament had been written in the collo-
quial Greek 01 ordinary 1116,* 80 these translations were in ’
colloquial Latin3 but that Latin was clear, forcible, and 0115611
magnificent. Many such independent translations were
current in J erome's time3 indeed, their number and variety
were causing serious inconvenience3 and so he was requested
by the Bishop 01 Rome (Damasus Ι., ΑΔ). 366-384) 150
examine them and, where they differed, to choose the ren-
dering which was nearest the Greek. This he did with the
aid 01 the most ancient Greek manuscripts, but making
alterations only when absolutely necessary. His edition

called it ‘⁶ Hellenistic '⁹ Greek.
