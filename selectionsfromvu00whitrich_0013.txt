Ι n the Old Testament, therefore, J erome’s work was almost
’ entirely a translation from the H ebrew.

None of the actual manuscripts written or corrected by
1 J erome survive. In the centuries between his age >and

the invention of printing, Vulgate Bibles were multiplied
by hand-copying, and numerous mistakes crept into the
text3 the need for a single standard edition was almost as

» great in the sixteenth century as in the fourth. After some ·

unsuccessful attemptS, such an edition was brought out at

’ Rome in 1592 under the auspices of Pope Clement VIII.,

. and hence called the Clementine Vulqate. The text was cor-

· rected by the aid of some ancient and good manuscripts;

and though the revision was not complete, the Clementine

’ Vulgate was a great improvement on earlier editionS.

Of late years much study has been given to the subject,
and scholars believe that they are now in a position to
reconstruct J erome’s Bible with some approach to certainty.
In the Church of Rome the Benedictine Order was in the

·, year 1907 entrusted by the Pope (Pius X.) with the task

, of bringing out a Revised Version of the whole Bible; and

vin due time it will no doubt appear. Meanwhile Dr. John
Χ Wordsworth (the late Bishop of Salisbury) had under-
taken in 1878 to revise the New Testament3 and though

ι the big edition, with full collations of variant readings, has

not yet been printed beyond the Epistle to the RomanS, a ⁷

small hand-edition of the complete New Testament was Α

published, under his direction, in 1911.*
